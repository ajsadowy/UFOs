## Overview of Project   
### Purpose   
The purpose of this project was to get a better understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of JavaScript.   
The objective to complete was to build a usable table that organized UFO data from a JavaScript array. This table has the feature of filtering multiple criteria in a live dynamic webpage built from HTML, CSS, and Bootstap.

## Results   
### At the Top of the Page

Here we have a small article that provides introductory information to the webpage. Below is an embeded music video to help with setting a fun and adventurous aesthetic to pump up vistors as they explore the data.
